/**
 * A very-high-quality StatefulRandomness that is the fastest 64-bit generator in this library that passes statistical
 * tests and is equidistributed. Has 64 bits of state and natively outputs 64 bits at a time, changing the state with a
 * basic linear congruential generator (it is simply {@code state = state * 1103515245 + 1}). Starting with that LCG's
 * output, it xorshifts that output, multiplies by a very large negative long, then returns another xorshift. For
 * whatever reason, the output of this simple function passes all 32TB of PractRand with no anomalies, meaning its
 * statistical quality is excellent. As mentioned earlier, this is the fastest high-quality generator here other than
 * {@link ThrustAltRNG}. Unlike ThrustAltRNG, this can produce all long values as output; ThrustAltRNG bunches some
 * outputs and makes producing them more likely while others can't be produced at all. Notably, this generator is faster
 * than {@link LightRNG} while keeping the same or higher quality, and also faster than {@link XoRoRNG} while passing
 * tests that XoRoRNG always or frequently fails, such as binary matrix rank tests.
 * <br>
 * This generator is a StatefulRandomness but not a SkippingRandomness, so it can't (efficiently) have the skip() method
 * that LightRNG has. A method could be written to run the generator's state backwards, though, as well as to get the
 * state from an output of {@link #nextLong()}. At least in theory, and supported in practice by how PCG-Random works,
 * this type of generator could be used to make a generator with multiple non-overlapping streams by changing the linear
 * congruential generator to add a different odd number instead of 1; any odd number should work, but optimizations can
 * apply to adding 1 that aren't possible for other numbers, so that's a good default to use here. A determine() method
 * could be written for LinnormRNG, but it couldn't be applied to sequential states with any suggestion of randomness,
 * and would need a more elaborate state transition applied across sequences of input.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from LINear congruential generator this uses to change it state, while the rest is a NORMal
 * SplitMix64-like generator. "Linnorm" is a Norwegian name for a kind of dragon, as well.
